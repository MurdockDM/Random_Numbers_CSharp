# Practice: Random Numbers


## Instructions
1. Create a list of random numbers. Each number will be between 0 and 5.
1. Determine if the current loop index is contained inside of the `numbers` list. Print a message to the console indicating whether the index is in the list.


#### Example Output in the Terminal
```sh
numbers list contains 0
numbers list does not contain 1
numbers list does not contain 2
numbers list contains 3
numbers list contains 4
numbers list does not contains 5
```
**NOTE:** Each run will produce different output.
